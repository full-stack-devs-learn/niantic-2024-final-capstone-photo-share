# Project Requirements

This is a high level description of your project. You should create detailed requirements and update this document
with those requirements. This will guide your development throughout the remainder of the project.

## Photo Share

PhotoShare is an app dedicated to documenting your life through photographs. Rather than a blog or vlog, 
this might be a phlog. 

Only photos are allowed, and they have to tell the story of your life.

Photos can have captions, but they must be limited to under 100 characters. Users should not be allowed to 
write an essay about their photo. If a user wants to tell more of the story, they need to upload additional
photos to give more detail.

Users should be able to create a storyboard that allows them to sort their photos to tell a story. A story
on this app is not a single photo, but it is a collection of photos that are in sequence.

You may consider using a slide-deck that auto plays a story.
